PDNS Edit
===========

PDNS Edit is a Web UI for PowerDNS' MySQL backend. It is intended to make managing large-scale PDNS deployments - such as those operated by ISPs or web hosting providers - easier.

It uses [CakePHP](http://cakephp.net) and Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.githum.com).

Installation
------------

These instructions assume that you want to host the UI in a folder off your website's root directory. If that's not whaat you want then adapt as necessary.

1. Create a directory in your webroot directory called pdnsedit and clone the repo into it:
  `git clone https://github.com/dermotw/pdnsedit`
2. Blah blah blah
